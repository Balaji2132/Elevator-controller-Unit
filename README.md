# Elevator-controller-Unit
Elevator Controller Unit using Microcontroller (PIC18F4620)
I have designed this ECU for upto three floors. Starting from floor 1 and going till floor 3.
I have used PIC18F4620 microcontroller for performing this task and making my Elevator fast and energy efficient.
You need to install MPLABX IDE with XC8 compiler to run the embedded C program and PICSIMLAB simulator to simulate the ECU.
